# Cottage_realistic_rendering
A realistic 3D model of a cottage being built by my father and I. Before the construction began my father wanted to see what the end product might look like, so I decided to use my modelling skills to make him a realistic render of the house. The 3D model was made in Blender and was based on the 2D drawings and plans my father drew by hand and scanned. This was a very fun project for me and I am proud of the result. A month after finishing the 3D renders, my father and I got to work on the real building. Pictures of the renders and the actual project are provided in this repo, as well as the original blender files made before the UI update to blender.

Put together some video and photos of the start of the construction of that house you designed.  We ended up putting a 22 degree angle in the middle of the house to fit it on the property, but otherwise it's pretty much the same as what you designed.  Thanks I hope it turns out as nice as what you drew.
